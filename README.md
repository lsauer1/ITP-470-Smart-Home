## How to Build Your Own:
### Materials Needed:
#### Google Account
The website to connect and control the devices requires a google login to create an account.
#### 3D Printer:
Currently the components will be entirely 3d printed, and as such a 3D printer with at least a 6x6" buildplate is required.
